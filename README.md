## Introduction and Scenario
  ### Introduction
  In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
  ### Scenario
  You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
## ASK
  Identify and understand the bike usage among annual members and casual riders in order to suggest marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.
This comparison along with other tasks will later be used by marketing department for developing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into members

## Data Preparation
